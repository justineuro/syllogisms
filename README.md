# Algorithmic Truth Table Method (ATTM)

[ ... _**still under construction**_ ...]  

Files related to the use of an Algorithmic Truth Table Method (ATTM) for proving the validity/invalidity of certain argument forms (singly-quantified and monadic).  In particular, the ATTM can be used for evaluating the validity of each of the 256 possible forms of a categorical syllogism (CS).

The method was previously presented in the following scientific meetings:

* Second Lecture Series for SY 2003-2004 of the Mathematical Society of the Philippines â€“ National Capital Region Chapter (November 22, 2003). Seminar Room, Mapua Institute of Technology, Intramuros, Manila.
* 2003 Science and Technology Research Colloquium (November 19, 2003). Thomas Aquinas Research Complex, University of Santo Tomas, Manila, Philippines.

## Color coding 
In the PDF file [256-tables.pdf](./256-tables.pdf), the table labels indicating the CS form, e.g., `Form: I-AAI`, for the first table, have been highlighted to indicate whether the form is valid/invalid (Aristotelian logic), or unconditionally/conditionally valid or invalid (Boolean logic). The color coding is as follows:

* <span style="background-color:#B8860B; fontcolor:black">dark goldenrod</span> -  indicates a valid CS in Aristotelian (with either a **loose** or an **express** definition of a CS) and an unconditionally valid CS in Boolean logic (there are **15** such truth tables)
* <span style="background-color:#DAA520; fontcolor:black">goldenrod</span> -  indicates a valid CS in Aristotelian logic and a conditionally valid CS in Boolean logic (there are **4** such truth tables)
* <span style="background-color:silver; fontcolor:black">silver</span> -  indicates a valid CS in Aristotelian logic with a **loose** definition of a CS, an invalid CS in Aristotelian logic with an **express** definition of a CS, and a conditionally valid CS in Boolean logic (there are **5** such truth tables).  The conclusion for each of these five CS is a weakened version of the conclusion of the corresponding CS in the first list of 15 CS.
* <span style="background-color:white; fontcolor:black">white</span> - invalid CS

Thus, in 

* **Aristotelian logic with an _express_ definition of a CS**, exactly **19** (<span style="background-color:#B8860B; fontcolor:black">15 dark goldenrod</span> + <span style="background-color:#DAA520; fontcolor:black">4 goldenrod</span>) CS are deemed to be **valid**; 
* **Aristotelian logic with a _loose_ definition of a CS**, exactly **24** (<span style="background-color:#B8860B; fontcolor:black">15 dark goldenrod</span> + <span style="background-color:#DAA520; fontcolor:black">4 goldenrod</span> + <span style="background-color:silver; fontcolor:black">5 silver</span>) CS are deemed to be **valid**; 
* **Boolean logic**, exactly **15** (<span style="background-color:#B8860B; fontcolor:black">only the 15 dark goldenrod</span>) CS are deemed to be ***unconditionally valid*** and **9** (<span style="background-color:#DAA520; fontcolor:black">4 goldenrod</span> + <span style="background-color:silver; fontcolor:black">5 silver</span>) CS are deemed ***conditionally valid*** subject to certain requirements on existential import (please see [List of valid argument forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_valid_argument_forms) for more information).


The PDF file [256-tables-sum.pdf](./256-tables-sum.pdf) shows the tables from [256-tables.pdf](./256-tables.pdf) after some of the steps from the algorithm have been implemented on them.  For example, for the first table (`Form: I-AAA (bArbArA)`), which has a valid form, implementing this ATTM requires object types `2`, `3`, `4`, and `6` to be deleted (yellow highlighting for the rows).  For the subuniverse containing the remaining objects types (`1`, `5`, `7`, and `8`), the two premises and the conclusion are all true, thus the form of this CS is valid in Aristotelian logic and unconditionally valid in Boolean logic (note that each term (minor (`S`), middle (`M`), and major (`P`)) have existential import, i.e., each term is present in the subuniverse of discourse).
